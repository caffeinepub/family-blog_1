  "summary": "The implementation successfully addresses all 9 requirements from the BuildRequest. Backend additions include like counter, like increment function, comments array, and add comment function in main.mo with proper persistence through migration.mo. Frontend additions include React Query hooks (useLikePost, useAddComment) with cache invalidation, CommentsList and CommentForm components, and UI updates to HomePage and PostDetailPage displaying like counts and interactive like buttons. All acceptance criteria appear to be met based on the diff evidence.",
